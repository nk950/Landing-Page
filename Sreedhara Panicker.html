            <b>Sreedhara Panicker</b>
           <p> Sreedhara Panicker Somanath was born in July 1963. He currently holds the position of Chairman at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). His leadership has been instrumental in achieving a historic milestone with the successful execution of Chandrayaan-3, India’s third lunar exploration mission.</p>

           <p> Under Somanath’s guidance, ISRO accomplished a groundbreaking feat on August 23, 2023, when the mission’s lander, Vikram, and the rover, Pragyan, executed a soft landing near the lunar south pole region. This achievement not only secured India’s position as the first country to softly land a spacecraft near the lunar south pole but also marked the fourth country globally to demonstrate a soft landing on the Moon.</p>
            
           <p> Somanath’s journey within ISRO is distinguished by his roles as the director of the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre in Thiruvananthapuram and the director of the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre, also in Thiruvananthapuram. His notable contributions span the spectrum of launch vehicle design, with expertise in launch vehicle systems engineering, structural design, structural dynamics, and pyrotechnics.</p> 
            
            <p>Born into a Malayali Nair family in Thuravoor, Alappuzha district of Kerala, Sreedhara Panicker Somanath’s educational journey took him through St. Augustine’s High School, Aroor, and Maharaja’s College, Ernakulam. His academic pursuits led him to earn a graduate degree in mechanical engineering from Thangal Kunju Musaliar College of Engineering, Kollam, and a master’s degree in aerospace engineering from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.</p>
            
            <p>Since joining ISRO in 1985, Somanath has played significantly important roles in key projects, including the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III. His leadership journey continued as the director of the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre and later as the director of the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre. In January 2022, he assumed the role of Chairman at ISRO, succeeding K. Sivan.</p>
            
            <p>Somanath’s remarkable contributions have not gone unnoticed. In 2023, the Government of Karnataka honored him with the prestigious Rajyotsava Award, recognizing his outstanding achievements. His leadership and dedication have significantly propelled India’s progress in space exploration, solidifying his standing as a respected figure in the field of aerospace engineering.</p>
