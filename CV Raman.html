        <b>CV Raman</b>
       <p> Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman, widely known as C.V. Raman, was a brilliant Indian physicist and famous personality in the world of science. Born on November 7, 1888, in Tiruchirapalli, India, Raman exhibited a keen interest in the mysteries of light and sound from a young age.</p>

        <p>Raman’s groundbreaking work in the field of physics earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930. His achievement was centered around the phenomenon of scattering of light, which he termed the “Raman Effect.” He discovered that when light passes through a transparent substance, some of the scattered light changes in color. This discovery revolutionized our understanding of light and earned him global recognition.
        </p>
        <p>Before receiving the Nobel Prize, C.V. Raman worked tirelessly as a professor and researcher. He held several esteemed positions, including the directorship of the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. Raman’s contributions extended beyond his scientific discoveries; he was a dedicated teacher, inspiring countless students to pursue careers in science.</p>
        
        
      <p>  In the context of India’s growth, Raman’s legacy is immeasurable. His work laid the foundation for modern physics research in the country and inspired a generation of Indian scientists. Raman’s emphasis on scientific inquiry and critical thinking contributed significantly to the development of a robust scientific community in India.</p>
